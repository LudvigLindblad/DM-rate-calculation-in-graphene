Python tool fo calculating differential ejection rate of electrons from DM-electon scattering in graphene.

To run the code please download the files listed. The tabel of eigenvectors C (3 in total) are to large to be stored at Github but can be generated from Graphene_wavefunctions.nb or be sent by request. Do note that the eigenvectors are only needed for the sigma bands.

The calculations are run through integration_station.py 

The integrals over q and k are performed in rate_calc.py, as well as the normalization, band energies for pi and sigma. 

The integration over lattice momentum is done in integration_station.py as a sum on a grid. To alter the scattering amplitude please change Fdm from 1 to 2 or 3. The band and gridsize is also set in integration_station.
Code to run an interpolation over lattice momentum can be found in Integration_station.py and give comparative results. Note however the interpolation were found to be somewhat unstables and needs to be expanded upon using it.

A benchmark method can be found in integration_method.py to determine optimal integration method, default is "Gauss-Legendre", but can be changed in integration_station.py

The constants used are given in SI units and are listed in constants.py 

Band energies and eigenvectors for sigma are gathered in loadtables.py
